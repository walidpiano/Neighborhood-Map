# Neighborhood Map
Do you need to have your local guide in my area? All what you need is to run my application ```Neighborhood Map``` :wink: !
This application is developed to help you know the most prominene places in the area. You can easily filter your favorite location, or simple select it from the navigation bar.
just run [index.html](https://github.com/walidpiano/Neighborhood-Map/blob/master/index.html) and enjoy :wink: !

## Installation
1. The application has all the required libraries already installed locally in this folder; [libs](https://github.com/walidpiano/Neighborhood-Map/tree/master/libs).
2. The application is built base on the below frameworks:
   - [JQuery](https://jquery.com/).
   - [knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/).
   - [bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/).
3. I also used the below API services:
   - ```google maps API```.
   - ```mapquestapi```.
4. To run the application, just open [index.html](https://github.com/walidpiano/Neighborhood-Map/blob/master/index.html)!

## Application Running:
Note that once you open the [index.html](https://github.com/walidpiano/Neighborhood-Map/blob/master/index.html):
1. A web application will open showing a map with the favorite locations, and a navigation menu including the same locations.
2. If you hover the mose over any location marker, it will give you a different color.
3. If you click on any location marker, an info window will show up including some information about the location (taken from ```mapquestapi```).
4. You can select any location using the help of the navigation pane on the left, and the selected location will bounce, and information window will show up.
5. To make it easier, you can also use the filter box. Just type any part of the location and press ```Enter```.

## Requirements
The application doesn't need any requirements to run. Just any web browser :smile: !

## Notification
Unfortunately, due to Google Maps new pricing plan, the map will look in a dark color!
